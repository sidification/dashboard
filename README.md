# Dashboard Project

Welcome to the Dashboard project! 

## About The Project

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard with a clean design and user-friendly interface. The dashboard includes sections like a sidebar, header, and main content area, each filled with various components like navigation links, user information, buttons, and more.

## Project Features
- **HTML and CSS Setup**: The project is set up with HTML and CSS files containing dummy content for initial setup and link verification.
- **CSS Grid Layout**: Grid properties are extensively used to build the layout of the dashboard. This includes the sidebar, header, and main content areas.
- **Nested Grids**: Grids are nested within grids to achieve a detailed and precise layout, allowing for greater customization and scalability.
- **Asset Gathering**: Icons, fonts, and color palettes have been incorporated into the design from resources like Material Design Icons, Google Fonts, and Tailwind respectively.
- **Customizable Design**: The project does not have to be responsive or a pixel-perfect match with any design example. It's an opportunity for you to experiment and create your own unique designs.
- **GitHub Pages**: The finished Dashboard is hosted on GitHub using GitHub Pages, making it accessible to the world!

## Building the Project

Here are the major steps involved in the creation of this project:

1. **Set Up and Planning**: Setting up HTML and CSS files, and planning the overall layout using a design file.
2. **Layout**: Writing out the HTML elements for the main sections and applying CSS Grid properties to build the basic layout.
3. **Nesting**: Systematically nesting child elements under parent elements in the HTML using grid containers. This is done for each section individually.
4. **Gathering Assets**: Once the layout is complete, assets like icons, fonts, and color palettes are gathered and incorporated into the design.
5. **Final Touches**: Applying final touches to the layout, experimenting with design, and pushing the finished dashboard to GitHub.
